# Telegram Auto Update name and username with Hashed values

Some of us want to stay very low profile and untracable. If you are looking for a tool that change telegram name and username at specific time (recommended is weekly), this tool is for you. This will automatically generate hashed values for your name and username and set those values to your account.

## Getting Started

You can setup this project in your VPS or locally. I personally recommend doing it on VPS since you are not going to open your personal computer all the time.

It was hard to explore Telegram documentation but luckily I found this awesome TDLib for NodeJs. You can checkout the library [here](https://https://github.com/Bannerets/tdl).

### Installation Guide

Generate `.env` file using this command.
